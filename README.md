A data analysis and machine learning pipeline to identify factors driving Uber ride cancellations and predict future booking failures.

# Uber Rides Analysis & Cancellation Prediction

A Python project focused on analyzing Uber ride data and developing a machine learning model to predict ride cancellations.

## ü§ñ Introduction

This repository contains a Python project analyzing Uber rides data and building a model to predict ride cancellations. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and a machine learning pipeline using scikit-learn. The goal is to identify key factors driving cancellations and provide a predictive tool for operational insights.

## üìù Project Overview

### Data Cleaning

- Handles missing values, nulls, and unnecessary columns.
- Creates a target variable is_cancelled.
- Generates features like hour_of_day for modeling.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualizes ride distributions, cancellation reasons, peak cancellation hours, and vehicle-specific patterns.

### Machine Learning Pipeline
- Trains a Decision Tree Classifier to predict if a ride will be cancelled.
- Handles categorical features using one-hot encoding.
- Provides sample predictions with probabilities.

## üìä Visualizations

Plots are generated inline during notebook execution:

- Distribution of rides by hour.
- Booking status distribution (Cancelled vs Completed).
- Cancellations by vehicle type.
- Peak cancellation hours.

Note: All plots are rendered in the notebook and will appear directly below their corresponding analysis functions.

## üéØ Key Findings (Executive Summary)

Based on the analysis and model training, the following key trends were identified:

- Cancellations peak sharply between 4 PM and 6 PM (evening rush hour), suggesting that external factors like traffic or driver availability heavily influence ride completion.

- Vehicle type 'A' has a 15% higher cancellation rate than the average across all other vehicle types, indicating a potential issue with routing, pricing, or driver assignment for that category.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Dataset Notice

The original dataset is not included due to privacy and file size constraints.
The original dataset, Uber Ride Analytics Dashboard, is sourced from the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashdevladdha/uber-ride-analytics-dashboard).

The cleaned dataset (clean_uber_rides_2024.csv) is included and can be used for EDA and modeling. If you have access to the original data, you can run the full pipeline starting from clean_and_save_data().

## üì¶ Requirements

Install the required Python packages:

<pre> pip install -r requirements.txt </pre>

### Key packages used:

- `pandas` **(v2.1.0)**
- `numpy` **(v1.26.0)**
- `matplotlib` **(v3.8.0)**
- `scikit-learn` **(v1.3.0)**

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Open uber-cancellation_prediction_model.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run cells sequentially: Data Cleaning $\rightarrow$ EDA $\rightarrow$ Model Training & Prediction.
3. Visualizations will appear directly under their respective function calls.
4. You can test predictions using the sample ride at the end of the notebook.
